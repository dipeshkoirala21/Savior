This project contains the Emergency Alert and Response System developed as a course project for CSE 535 Mobile Computing.

It is an android application that uses historical crime data and user's current location to trigger an alert and response system when the user is determined to be in danger.

The application utilizes a fall detection algorithm and network status to detect an emergency and alerts the emergency contacts with the user's location.
